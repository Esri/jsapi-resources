# @arcgis/core (ES modules)

The sample projects in this directory demonstrate using [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with various frameworks, module bundlers and build tools. `@arcgis/core` is installed using [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-locally), and is intended for use in local builds that you host.

### Get Started

Run `npm install` in a project directory and then start adding ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript functionality.

For additional information, see the [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) Guide topic in the SDK.

### TypeScript

For TypeScript users, the type definitions are included when you install `@arcgis/core`. There is no need for a separate install.

### Troubleshooting

Building applications locally involves understanding many interrelated pieces including frameworks, module bundlers, transpilers, dependency libraries and the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. Refer to our [Troubleshooting issues with local builds](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/troubleshooting/) guide topic for guidance on narrowing down the potential sources for issues.

### Bundle size and performance

For each release, we track certain metrics including bundle size and web application performance. These files can be found in the [/esm-samples/.metrics](./.metrics/) directory. You can read more about how we capture this information this [README](../.github/scripts/README.md).

The number and size of bundles is dependant on multiple factors and will vary based on framework, module bundler, transpiling and related configurations, as well as the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript functionality that has been implemented. The compile process can output several hundred or more bundles on-disk due to using dynamic imports. At runtime, your application will typically only load a portion of the bundles depending on which `@arcgis/core` modules are used in your project. 

If you run the performance metrics script locally, the performance indicators will vary depending on the device or virtual machine that runs the script. The metrics are best used for analysing trends over time, and they should always be run on the same device in order to keep as many of the variables constant as possible. The calculations are dependant on many hardware and software factors including CPU load, memory usage and internet speed during the time window that the script is running. For example, the numbers you see using a GitHub action may be significantly different from when you run the scripts locally on your development machine.
