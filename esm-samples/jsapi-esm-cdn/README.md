# ArcGIS API for JavaScript ES modules via CDN

We currently recommend only using the ES modules (ESM) via CDN for testing and prototyping. The ESM CDN build isn't optimized for fast loading. 

For best performance either build the ES modules locally or use [AMD modules via the ArcGIS CDN](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/install-and-set-up/#amd-modules-via-arcgis-cdn).

## Configuration

None.
