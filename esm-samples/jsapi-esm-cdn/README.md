# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript ES modules via CDN

We currently recommend only using the ES modules (ESM) via CDN for testing and prototyping. The ESM CDN build is not optimized for fast loading. 

For best performance use the [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) npm package.

## Configuration

None.
