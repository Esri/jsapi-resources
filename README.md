Resources for the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript
===============
A collection of resources for developers using the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://js.arcgis.com). Refer to the README files in each subdirectory for specific instructions on how to use a particular resource. 

## Samples

This repository provides a collection of code samples that provide _proof-of-concept_ for using the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript components and core API with a variety of popular build tools, frameworks and module bundlers. 

* [Components samples](./component-samples/)
* [Core API samples](./core-samples/)

## HTML OAuth callback page

If you have set OAuthInfo's [`popup`](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-identity-OAuthInfo.html#popup) property to `true`, you'll need to host a [callback page](./oauth/) on your server. For more information, visit the Maps SDK's [Access secure resources](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/secure-resources/) guide topic.

## TypeScript declaration files

TypeScript definitions are included in the [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) npm package.
