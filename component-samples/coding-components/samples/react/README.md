This repository showcases how to integrate the coding components with [React](https://react.dev/).

## Get started

The project was created using [`yarn create vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with the [React template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react).

Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.

***Note:*** This sample demonstrates the recommended pattern for using components from the ArcGIS Map SDK for JavaScript by individually loading components.

### Loading All Components
The JavaScript Maps SDK also offers a convenience pattern useful for quick testing and prototyping. You can register all components at once using the following approach:

```
// Replace the individual imports with defineCustomElements()
 import { defineCustomElements as defineCalciteElements } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader";
 import { defineCustomElements as defineCodingElements } from "@arcgis/coding-components/dist/loader";

 defineCalciteElements(window, { resourcesUrl: "https://js.arcgis.com/calcite-components/2.13.2/assets" });
 defineCodingElements(window, { resourcesUrl: "https://js.arcgis.com/coding-components/4.31/assets" });
```

For more details on using the SDK, please refer to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started-overview/).
