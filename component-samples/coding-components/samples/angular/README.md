## Known issues

- The [@arcgis/coding-components-angular](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/coding-components-angular) npm package has been deprecated at 4.31. We recommend using the `@arcgis/coding-components`, as shown in the sample.
- The compile warning `The glob pattern import("./**/*.entry.js*") did not match any files [empty-glob]` is a known issue with Stencil and it can be ignored.
- You may encounter the following build configuration error:
  `[ERROR] No loader is configured for ".ttf" files: node_modules/monaco-editor/esm/vs/base/browser/ui/codicons/codicon/codicon.ttf`.

To fix this, the following has been added to the `angular.json` configuration file in this sample:

```json
"loader": {
  ".ttf": "file"
}
```
