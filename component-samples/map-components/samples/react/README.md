This repository showcases how to use map components with [React](https://react.dev/).

## Get started

The project was created using [`yarn create vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with the [React template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react).

Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.

**_Note:_** This sample demonstrates the recommended pattern for using components from the ArcGIS Map SDK for JavaScript by individually loading components.

For more details on using the SDK, please refer to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started-overview/).
