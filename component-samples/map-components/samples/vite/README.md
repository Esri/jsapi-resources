This project showcases how to integrate the map components using Vite.

## Get started

The project was created using [`npm create vite`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) with the [vanilla JavaScript template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-vanilla).

Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.

**_Note:_** This sample demonstrates the recommended pattern for using components from the ArcGIS Map SDK for JavaScript by individually loading components.

For more details on using the SDK, please refer to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started-overview/).

## Known issues

- It is recommended to avoid using [top level await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await) in vanilla Vite applications due to limitations in Rollup production builds that may result in runtime application hangs. There are multiple alternatives. You can use [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), async [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), async [IIFEs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), or use the SDK's events.
