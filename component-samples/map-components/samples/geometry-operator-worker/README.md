# Map components geometry operator worker sample

This project demonstrates using the SDK's geometry operators inside a web worker. You can continue to perform tasks in the user interface while the worker handles potentially resource intensive processing on a background thread. The worker implementation is simplified by using [comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink).

The worker's `geometry-operator-worker.mjs` module is used to query a feature service for river and stream line segments that are contained within a buffer. Then it loops through the features, that are returned from the query, and creates buffers around all the line segments. The segments are then generalized for better serialization performance when the data is passed back to the main thread for display on the map.

## Get started

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies, and then `npm run dev` to see the application in developer mode.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.

For more details on using the SDK, please refer to the [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript documentation](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/get-started/).

## Known issues

- It is recommended to avoid using [top level await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await) in vanilla Vite applications due to limitations in Rollup production builds that may result in runtime application hangs. There are multiple alternatives. You can use [async functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), async [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), async [IIFEs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), or use the SDK's events.
