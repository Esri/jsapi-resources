# OAuth

## Requirements

* [ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript](https://js.arcgis.com)

## Instructions

If you have set OAuthInfo's `popup` property to `true`, you'll need to host a callback page on your server. Save the [oauth-callback.html](oauth-callback.html) page in the same folder as your application page. You can optionally change the location or name by setting the OAuthInfo's `popupCallbackUrl` property.
