This repository showcases how to integrate the coding components using webpack.

## Project setup

Instructions for setup after you save this directory to your machine.

### Install dependencies

#### npm

```
npm install
```

#### yarn

```
yarn install
```

### Start the development server

#### npm

```
npm run start
```

#### yarn

```
yarn start
```

### Generate the production-ready compiled code

#### npm

```
npm run build
```

#### yarn

```
yarn build
```

#### JS

Imported the components using [Stencil's pattern for integrating components without a JavaScript framework](https://stenciljs.com/docs/javascript).

```js
import { defineCustomElements as defineCalciteElements } from "@esri/calcite-components/dist/loader";
import { defineCustomElements as defineCodingElements } from "@arcgis/coding-components/dist/loader";

// define custom elements in the browser, and load the assets from the CDN
defineCalciteElements(window, { resourcesUrl: "https://js.arcgis.com/calcite-components/2.5.1/assets" });
defineCodingElements(window, { resourcesUrl: "https://js.arcgis.com/coding-components/4.29/assets" });
```

Use [`src/index.js`](./src/index.js) to load the data, define custom elements, and utilize various kinds of properties in the editor. Both the Calcite and Coding elements must be defined.

#### CSS

You can find all the necessary styling in [`src/index.css`](./src/index.css). Importing the global Calcite and coding components CSS is required.

```
@import "https://js.arcgis.com/coding-components/4.29/arcgis-coding-components.css";
@import "https://js.arcgis.com/calcite-components/2.5.1/calcite.css";
```

#### HTML

Parsing the `index.html` was simplified by using the HtmlWebpackPlugin in the webpack configuration file.

```js
// webpack.config.js
const HtmlWebPackPlugin = require("html-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebPackPlugin({
      title: "Coding components Webpack template",
      template: "./public/index.html",
      filename: "./index.html",
      chunksSortMode: "none",
      inlineSource: ".(css)$"
    }),
    ...
  ]
};
```
