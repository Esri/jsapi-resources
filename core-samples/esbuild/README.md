# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript with esbuild

This sample demonstrates how to use the [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with esbuild.

## Known issues

- This sample uses esbuild code splitting which outputs a large number of on-disk files. For best performance use [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) or [HTTP/3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_3) for production environments. For more information: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting.
