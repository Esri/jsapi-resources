# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript with esbuild

This sample demonstrates how to use the [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with esbuild.

**Work in progress** - this sample uses esbuild code splitting. It's best used in [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) production environments. For more information: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting.

## Get Started

Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.

For additional information, see the [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) Guide topic in the SDK.
