# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript with esbuild

This sample demonstrates how to use the [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with esbuild.

**Work in progress** - this sample uses esbuild code splitting. It's best used in [HTTP/2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2) production environments. For more information: https://esbuild.github.io/api/#splitting.
