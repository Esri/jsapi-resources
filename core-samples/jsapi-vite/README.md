# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript with Vite (Deprecated)

This sample demonstrates how to use [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) without a framework.

**DEPRECATED** since 4.34. New applications should be built with [components](../../component-samples/). Read about the [transition plan from widgets to components](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/components-transition-plan/).
