# Custom UI component with React and Vite

This sample demonstrates creating a custom UI component using [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with [React](https://react.dev/learn) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#community-templates). You can also use any other major JavaScript framework. For more information about building custom UI with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, see the [Custom UI basics](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/custom-ui/) guide topic.

The component in this sample is created in [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx) and then added to the Map as a DOM element using the ArcGIS JS SDK's [View UI](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/view-ui/) interface. This approach loosely couples the component with the functionality in the SDK. It provides seamless integration with your preferred component library, and gives you full control over the user experience and component lifecycle so that it fits your unique requirements.
