# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript ES modules via CDN

Use the ES modules (ESM) via the ArcGIS CDN only for testing and prototyping. The ESM CDN is not optimized for fast loading. This is related to the ES modules specification, and not a function of the SDK. 

For best performance, build your application locally using the [@arcgis/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) npm package. Local build tools, which are typically included in all frameworks, offer the ability to take advantage of tree shaking, chunking, bundling, minimizing and obfuscating in a way that works best for your application.
