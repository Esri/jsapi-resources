# ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript with webpack

This sample demonstrates how to use the [`@arcgis/core`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@arcgis/core) ES modules with webpack.

- *NOTE:* Compatibility of the SDK with Webpack versions prior to `5.84.0` was removed at 4.29.

## Get Started

Run `npm install` and then start adding modules.

For a list of all available `npm` commands see `scripts` in `package.json`, e.g. `npm run build`.

For additional information, see the [Build with ES modules](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/es-modules/) Guide topic in the SDK.
