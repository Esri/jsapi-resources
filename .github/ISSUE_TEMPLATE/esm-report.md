<!--
STEP 1: Are you in the right place?

- Are you using a local build of @arcgis/core ES modules? 

- Have you already searched [open](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/issues) and [closed](https://github.com/Esri/jsapi-resources/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) issues on this repo? 

- Have you tried to reproduce the bug in a vanilla JS app using the CDN? This helps isolate the issue from any potential framework or bundler interference. See the ESM CDN sample in this repo for an example. You can also use the AMD CDN since the AMD and ESM builds have the same functionality.

If you answered yes, then you're in the right place, please delete this comment and file an issue right here!
